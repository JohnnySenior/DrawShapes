# DrawShapes

We are thrilled to introduce the first release of our Console Shape Drawing App - an innovative tool that allows users to unleash their creativity and engage in the art of shape creation using the power of the asterisk (*).

Have a look at `Program.cs` file and you can see how I have used:

1. Console input/output =>

    ![image](./Assets/console.png)

2. Switch statement =>

3. Foor Loop =>

4. `Methods` => I create several **_methods_** and programm refactored with these methods.

    * Creating method:

        ![image](./Assets/create.png)

    * Calling method:

        ![image](./Assets/call.png)

5. `Class` => I create three class and move all `methods` into these classes. As a result, I managed to make 134 lines of code into 25 lines. But the function of the program has not changed at all.

6. Result =>
